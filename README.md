OpenCore Efi HP PROBOOK G4 450

I was using flawlessly with Clover, Catalina and I needed to update Big Sur and OpenCore, I directly ported kext, updating them to the latest versions, Acpi patches and dsdt and ssdt patches

Everything works except SD Card Reader and Nvdia Gpu

Don't forget to generate a serial number and etc. in SMBios in config.plist
